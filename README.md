# Prime-my-past   ② ⑶ ❺ ⓻ 𝟙𝟙

Enter a number, n and see a multiplication table of the first n prime numbers!

## How to run it
- Make sure you've got node.js installed first of all.
- Then in your terminal clone this repository to your local computer and move into the directory.
```
git clone git@github.com:kitkat119/prime-my-past.git
cd prime-my-past
```
- Next install those dependencies.
```
npm install
```
- Then get started with:
```
node index.js
```

You will be prompted to enter the number of primes you wish to see. This must be a minimum of 1 and cannot be infinity, a decimal, a negative number or zero! If you do try and make an invalid request, you will be prompted to retry. The multiplication table of your chosen number of primes will then be printed!

## Tests

I wrote this application using Test Driven Development. To run the tests enter this into the terminal:
